The tool is used for other analytical needs such as obtaining the largest eigenvalue of the matrix through the method called eigenvalue decomposition for use in Principal Component Analysis, and as a basic tool for Pairs trading strategy construction.  We are going to have a review of this tool and some of the issues that arises in application and how to solve them using industry established techniques."

The range of the matrix is between [-1, 1] with the coefficient of -1 implying that data trend is in different directions, when one of the pair goes up the other of the pair goes down, in the diagram below it is symbolized by the dark black shaded box which are the following companies **TuSimple Holdings Inc** and **Pinduoduo Inc**, it is not easy to see **Pinduoduo Inc** as it name was omitted by the visualization framework during computations. The Netflix to Netflix correlation take a value of 1, satisfying the conditions of $C_{ii}=1$  The correlation of the stock to its self is 1."
