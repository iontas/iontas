The tool is used for other analytical needs such as obtaining the largest eigenvalue of the matrix through the method called eigenvalue decomposition for use in Principal Component Analysis, and as a basic tool for Pairs trading strategy construction.  We are going to have a review of this tool and some of the issues that arises in application and how to solve them using industry established techniques."
